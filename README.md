# 3D-TFG-VICADEL
# Final Degree Project - Vicadel

Hello! Welcome to the code repository and relevant information about Vicadel's Final Degree Project. Here you will find all the necessary code for the implementation and programming of the ESP32 board, which is essential for the operation of the 3D-printed arm prosthesis.

# This repository includes various files, such as:
- Initial code for testing the servomotors.
- Final code that integrates the operation through the Aoutecen EMG sensor.
- All the codes used for improvements and tests.

The objective is to provide a complete and detailed guide that facilitates the understanding and use of this project. I hope you enjoy the code and find all the information perfectly clear and useful for your needs.

# Repository Structure

- Initial Code: Files with basic examples for testing servomotors.
- Final Code: Optimized code ready for use with the Aoutecen EMG sensor.
- Improvements and Tests: Various files showing the iterations and improvements made during the project development.

## Usage Instructions

1. ESP32 Setup:
   - Download and install the Arduino software.
   - Configure the environment for the ESP32 and upload the corresponding code.

2. Connecting the EMG Sensors:
   - Connect the EMG sensors to the analog pins of the ESP32.
   - Ensure proper placement of the electrodes on the appropriate muscles.

3. Testing and Adjustments:
   - Perform initial tests to verify the prosthesis response.
   - Adjust the tension of the cables and the code parameters to improve the system's accuracy and response.

For more details, consult the attached files and documentation in this repository. If you have any questions or need additional assistance, you can contact me at vicadel@alumni.uv.es.

I hope you enjoy exploring and using this project as much as I enjoyed developing it!
